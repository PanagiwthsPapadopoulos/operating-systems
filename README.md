# Operating Systems - Project

## Overview

This repository contains projects and implementations related to Operating Systems concepts. The projects in this repository demonstrate various core principles, including process management, memory management, file systems, scheduling algorithms, and synchronization techniques. The goal of this repository is to provide working examples and explanations of the underlying concepts of modern operating systems.

## Features

The repository includes implementations for the following key topics:

- **Process Management:**
  - Process creation, scheduling, and termination.
  - Simulating different scheduling algorithms (e.g., Round-Robin, First-Come-First-Served).
  
- **Memory Management:**
  - Memory allocation and deallocation strategies.
  - Virtual memory and paging mechanisms.
  
- **File Systems:**
  - File system creation, management, and manipulation.
  - Implementation of file system operations like read, write, delete, and create.
  
- **Synchronization:**
  - Implementing synchronization primitives like semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables.
  - Solving synchronization problems like the producer-consumer problem, dining philosophers, etc.

### Key Components

- **process_management/**: Contains implementations for different process scheduling algorithms and process management techniques.
  
- **memory_management/**: Includes implementations for memory allocation strategies, virtual memory management, and page replacement algorithms.

- **file_systems/**: Includes the creation of a simple file system along with basic file operations.

- **synchronization/**: Demonstrates synchronization concepts like semaphores, mutexes, and solving synchronization issues in concurrent programming.

## Installation
