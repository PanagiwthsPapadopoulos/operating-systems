# 🖥️ Operating Systems - Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains projects and implementations related to **Operating Systems** concepts. The projects demonstrate various core principles, including **process management, memory management, file systems, scheduling algorithms, and synchronization techniques**. The goal is to provide working examples and explanations of the underlying concepts of modern operating systems.  

## ✨ Features  

The repository includes implementations for the following key topics:  

- **⚙️ Process Management:**  
  - 🏗 Process creation, scheduling, and termination.  
  - 🔄 Simulating different scheduling algorithms (e.g., **Round-Robin, First-Come-First-Served**).  

- **🧠 Memory Management:**  
  - 📦 Memory allocation and deallocation strategies.  
  - 📑 Virtual memory and paging mechanisms.  

- **📂 File Systems:**  
  - 🗃️ File system creation, management, and manipulation.  
  - ✏️ Implementation of file operations like **read, write, delete, and create**.  

- **🔄 Synchronization:**  
  - 🔐 Implementing **synchronization primitives** like **semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables**.  
  - 🤝 Solving synchronization problems like the **producer-consumer problem** and **dining philosophers**.  

## 📁 Key Components  

- **📑 process_management/**: Contains implementations for different **process scheduling algorithms** and management techniques.
